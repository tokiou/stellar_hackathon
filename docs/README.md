# Compass docs

This folder contains the active product and migration documentation for **Compass MCP Guard**.

## Canonical source

- [`PRODUCT_CONSTITUTION.md`](PRODUCT_CONSTITUTION.md) is the product source of truth.
- Feature specs live in their own folders: `docs/<feature-name>/functional-spec.md`, `technical-spec.md`, and `task.json`.
- This repo uses `docs/` as the only canonical documentation tree. Do not create or mirror OpenSpec artifacts in `openspec/`.

## What moved to `legacy/`

Wave 3.5 isolated the previous chat/wallet application under [`../legacy/`](../legacy/):

- `legacy/front/` — old React chat/wallet UI.
- `legacy/app/` — old App Router routes: `/home`, `/dynamic-reset`, and `/api/**`.
- `legacy/back/` — old chat-product backend services and tests.
- `legacy/docs/`, `legacy/sdd/`, `legacy/learning-explanations/` — historical docs and SDD artifacts.
- `legacy/scripts/` — old devnet/chat utility scripts.
- `legacy/public/architecture-explainer.html` — old Wallet Copilot branded static page.

The main tree must not import from `legacy/`. ESLint blocks this explicitly.

## Main-tree docs rule

Use this structure for new feature work:

```txt
docs/<feature-name>/
├── functional-spec.md
├── technical-spec.md
└── task.json
```

Use kebab-case feature names, for example `docs/mcp-tool-boundary/` or `docs/swap-behind-gateway/`.

Root-level docs should be only cross-cutting documents, indices, or historical files that remain relevant to the MCP Guard direction.

OpenSpec is intentionally not used in this repository. If a future workflow needs OpenSpec, first decide whether to migrate the canonical docs instead of duplicating them.
